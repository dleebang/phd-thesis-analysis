# Correlated evolution between traits  

# PGLS assuming no phylogenetic covariance (=OLS)
# PGLS assuming Brownian motion (covariance represents proportional branch lenghts)
# PGLS with incorporated phylogenetic signal (lambda = 1 or 0) on VCV matrix (this is important due to sample size! Kamilar & Cooper 2013)
# PGLS calculate estimates of both regression parameters of two traits and lambda (phy. signal) on residuals of a regression

# PGLS for multimodel inference according to AICc values (backwise step model selection)


# plot residuals from pgls for each species (e.g. larynx size vs body size)
