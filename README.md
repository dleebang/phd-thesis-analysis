# phd-thesis-analysis
R scripts written for my PHD thesis (under construction)

Those R scripts are being written to analyze the data from my PHD thesis. The scripts use several statistical models to test biological hypothesis and to make inferences based on these analysis. The main packages/libraries being used are phytools, geiger, caper, ape, phangorn, phylobase, and tidyverse. 

The dataset is still not available for external use since it is still unpublished.
